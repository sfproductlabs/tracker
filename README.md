# Tracker
User telemetry. Currently in production use, capturing hundreds of millions of records.

Track every visitor click, setup growth experiments and measure every user outcome and growth loop all under one roof for all of your sites/assets without any external tools at unlimited scale (it's the same infrastructure that the big boys use: CERN, Netflix, Apple, Github). It's not exactly going to be a drop in replacement for Google Analytics, but it will go far beyond it to help you understand your users' experience. 

Don't want to give your user data to people you don't trust? Maybe save a GDPR lawsuit by using this. We've seen a marked drop in people sharing their data with Google Analytics, so this will allow you to get your own trusted statistics yourself. Solves problems with data sovereignty, data-residency and inter-continental privacy localization.

## Todo
* Kafka plugin
* NATS/Kafka converter/repeater
* Flink plugin
* Druid Plugin
* Apache SNS 
* Websocket Proxy (Ex. https://github.com/yhat/wsutil/blob/master/wsutil.go, https://gist.github.com/bradfitz/1d7bdf12278d4d713212ce6c74875dab) or wait for go 1.12

## Instructions

* Install Cassandra or Elassandra
* Install Schema to Cassandra https://github.com/dioptre/tracker/blob/master/.setup/schema.3.cql
* Insall Go > 1.9.3 (if you want to build from source)
* Get the tracker (if you want to build from source) ```go get github.com/dioptre/tracker && go build github.com/dioptre/tracker```
* You may need to update pebble to an older commit (b64dcf2173d7fa03f54db3df14b89876fa807e42) works.
* Install Nats ```go get github.com/nats-io/gnatsd && go build github.com/nats-io/gnatsd```
* Go through the config.json file and change what you want.
* Deploy using Docker or ```go build```
* Use Spark, Kibana, etc to interrogate & ETL to your warehouse

## API
### Track Request
Send the server something to track (replace tr with str if it's from an internal service):

#### REST Payload Example
In the following example, we use tuplets to persist what's needed to track (Ex. {"tr":"v1"})
```
https://localhost:8443/tr/v1/vid/14fb0860-b4bf-11e9-8971-7b80435315ac/ROCK/ON/lat/37.232332/lon/6.32233223/first/true/score/6/ref/14fb0860-b4bf-11e9-8971-7b80435315ac
```
#### JSON Payload Example (Method:POST, Body)
Descriptions of the columns we send are in the schema file above. (Ex. vid = visitorId)
```json
{"last":"https://localhost:5001/cw.html","url":"https://localhost:5001/cw.html","params":{"type":"a","aff":"Bespoke"},"created":1539102052702,"duration":34752,"vid":"3d0be300-cbd2-11e8-aa59-ffd128a54d91","first":"false","sid":"3d0be301-cbd2-11e8-aa59-ffd128a54d91","tz":"America/Los_Angeles","device":"Linux","os":"Linux","sink":"cw$","score":1,"eid":"cw-a","uid":"admin"}
```
#### Failed Example
```
curl -k --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"app":"native","email":"lalala@aaa.com","uid":"179ea090-6e8c-11ea-bb89-1d0ba023ecf8","uname":null,"tz":"Europe/Warsaw","device":"Handset","os":"iOS 13.4","did":"758152C1-278C-4C80-84A0-CF771B000835","w":375,"h":667,"rel":1,"sid":"c1dcf340-6eaa-11ea-a0b8-6120e9776df7","time":1585149028377,"ename":"filter_results","etyp":"filter","ptyp":"own_rooms","page":1,"vid":"016f2740-6e8c-11ea-9f0b-5d70c66851be"}' \
  https://localhost:443/tr/v1/ -vvv
```
#### Good Example
* Notice the additional param "page" needed to be a string
* Notice the "rel" application release also needed to be a string 
```
curl -k --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"app":"native","email":"lalala@aaa.com","uid":"179ea090-6e8c-11ea-bb89-1d0ba023ecf8","uname":null,"tz":"Europe/Warsaw","device":"Handset","os":"iOS 13.4","did":"758152C1-278C-4C80-84A0-CF771B000835","w":375,"h":667,"rel":"1","sid":"c1dcf340-6eaa-11ea-a0b8-6120e9776df7","time":1585149028377,"ename":"filter_results","etyp":"filter","ptyp":"own_rooms","page":"1","vid":"016f2740-6e8c-11ea-9f0b-5d70c66851be"}' \
  https://localhost:443/tr/v1/ -vvv
```

### Shortened URLs

#### List Shortened URLs for a site

curl -k --request GET https://localhost:8443/rpi/v1/redirects/14fb0860-b4bf-11e9-8971-7b80435315ac/password/yoursitename.com
```
#### Create a Shortened URL

  https://localhost:8443/rpi/v1/redirect/14fb0860-b4bf-11e9-8971-7b80435315ac/password/yoursitename.com
```


### Testing

Be extremely careful with schema. For performance, the _tracker_ takes client requests, and dumps the connection for speed. https://github.com/sfproductlabs/tracker/blob/0b205c5937ca6362ba7226b065e9750d79d107e0/.setup/schema.3.cql#L50

### Debugging
You can run a docker version of tracker using ```docker-compose up``` then ```./tracker``` after tracker is built. There is a setting in the ```config.json``` to enable debug tracing on the command line. It will print any errors to the console of the running service. These are not saved, or distributed to any log for performance reasons. So test test test.


### Deploy

#### Docker
* Get a certificate:
    * Deploy on AWS with config parameters in conjunction with KMS on ECS on Amazon AWS https://hackernoon.com/you-should-use-ssm-parameter-store-over-lambda-env-variables-5197fc6ea45b (see dockercmd.sh)
    * Use the above test key **must be server.crt and server.key**
    * Copy a server.crt and server.key in from sn SSL certificate provider.
* Update **config.json** to **UseLocalTLS=true** if required.
* Deploy on Docker using the following:
```
# Build from src:
sudo docker build -t tracker .
# Deploy only:
# sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.deploy -t tracker .
sudo docker run -p 8443:443 tracker
# Connect to it:
#  sudo docker ps
#  sudo docker exec -it [container_id] bash
# Remove all your images (warning):
#  sudo docker system prune -a
```
* Then upload/use (try AWS ECS).

mkdir tracker
cd tracker/
git clone https://github.com/sfproductlabs/tracker .

## Privacy
Since GDPR, honest reporting about user telemetry is required. The default tracker for online (https://github.com/dioptre/tracker/blob/master/.setup/www/track.js) uses a number of cookies by default:
* COOKIE_REFERRAL (ref): An entity that referred you to the site. 
* COOKIE_EXPERIMENT (xid): An experiment that you are in. A/B testing a button title for example.
* COOKIE_EXP_PARAMS (params): Additional information (experiment parameters) that stores information about you anonymously that can be used to tailor the experience to you.
* COOKIE_TRACK (trc): The last time you were tracked.
* COOKIE_VID (vid): Your unique id. This is consistent across all sessions, and is stored on your device.
* COOKIE_SESS (sess,sid): The session id. Each time you visit/use the site it's approximately broken into session ids.
* COOKIE_JWT (jwt): The encrypted token of your user. This may optionally include your user id (uid) if logged in.

### Pruning Records
* Run  ```./tracker --prune config.json``` to run privacy pruning.

## Testing

### Testing within ECS docker container

* Make sure Debug in config.json is set to **true**
* Try running in an ecs instance (`ssh -l ec2-user 172.18.99.1; docker ps; docker exec -it aaa bash;`):
```bash
apt install curl procps vim

#Find the process
ps waux | grep tracker
#Kill the old tracker process with kill
#kill 70
#Replace "Debug" : true (in config.json)
#Run . /tracker/tracker config.json
#Do this QUICKLY before the machine is swapped out due to excessive downtime 

#Run your test in another terminal... ssh -l ec2-user 172.18.99.1 (from ecs service) and docker exec -it aa bash
